Black is the darkest betrayal， forgiveness Who Loved the pain。
Everybody live for themselves， we may be the no complaints。
Wish one day， you will suddenly told me that you still love me。
Ican only love you one， because I have only got a full of love。
Life is not what you have gained but what you have done。
Love is photogenic。 It needs darkness to develop。
Let go hand in a noisy streets， find the pupil picture。
